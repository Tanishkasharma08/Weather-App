#  **Weather App 🌤️ – Python Desktop Weather Application**

Weather App is a simple and interactive desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter. The app fetches and displays real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API, making it a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates API integration, GUI development, and basic backend logic.

## **Key Features**
- Search for any city worldwide
- Displays current temperature, "feels like" temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather description
- Interactive and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter
- Handles invalid city names and connection errors gracefully
- Beginner-friendly Python project for practicing API calls and GUI

## **Technologies and Tools Used**
- Python
- Tkinter
- Requests (for API calls)
- OpenWeatherMap API
- VS Code
- GitHub

## **Project Functionality**
- Accepts city name input from the user
- Fetches real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap API
- Processes and displays temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and pressure
- Demonstrates GUI development with Tkinter and API integration

## **How to Run the Project Locally**
1. Install Python on your system
2. Install dependencies using the command:
pip install requests
3. Replace the API key in weather_app.py with your OpenWeatherMap API key:
   api_key = "795d0d22cf67b728e9f884e11eab217b"
4. Run the application:
python weather_app.py
5. Enter a city name in the app and click Search or press Enter

## **Project Structure**
- weather_app.py → Main Python file with Tkinter GUI and weather logic
- README.md → Project documentation

## **Learning Outcomes**
- Understanding Tkinter GUI basics
- Fetching and processing data from APIs using Python
- Handling errors and exceptions in Python applications
- Building and documenting a beginner-friendly Python project
- Practicing full-stack development fundamentals with API integration
